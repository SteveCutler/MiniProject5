# In today's digital age, online shopping has become an integral part of our lives. E-commerce platforms 
# have revolutionized the way we purchase products, offering convenience, variety, and accessibility like 
# never before. However, building a robust e-commerce application from scratch can be a complex task, 
# involving various components such as user management, product listings, shopping carts, and order processing.

# Imagine you are tasked with creating an e-commerce application that empowers both customers and administrators. 
# The goal is to build a user-friendly platform where customers can effortlessly browse products, add them to their
# shopping carts, and place orders. Simultaneously, administrators should have tools to manage product inventory, 
# track orders, and ensure a seamless shopping experience.

# To tackle this challenge, we will leverage the power of Python and two essential libraries: Flask and Flask-SQLAlchemy. 
# Flask is a lightweight web framework that simplifies web application development, while Flask-SQLAlchemy provides a 
# robust toolkit for database interactions. Together, they form the perfect duo to craft our e-commerce solution.

# In this project, we will guide you through the process of building an e-commerce application that closely mimics 
# real-world scenarios.

#         Restock Products When Low (Bonus): Develop an endpoint that monitors product stock levels and triggers restocking 
# when they fall below a specified threshold. Ensure that stock replenishment is efficient and timely.

#     Order Processing:

#     Develop comprehensive Orders Management functionality to efficiently handle customer orders, ensuring that customers 
# can place, track, and manage their orders seamlessly.
#         Place Order: Create an endpoint for customers to place new orders, specifying the products they wish to purchase
#       and providing essential order details. Each order should capture the order date and the associated customer.
#         Retrieve Order: Implement an endpoint that allows customers to retrieve details of a specific order based on its 
# unique identifier (ID). Provide a clear overview of the order, including the order date and associated products.
#         Track Order: Develop functionality that enables customers to track the status and progress of their orders. Customers
# should be able to access information such as order dates and expected delivery dates.
#         Manage Order History (Bonus): Create an endpoint that allows customers to access their order history, listing all 
# previous orders placed. Each order entry should provide comprehensive information, including the order date and associated products.
#         Cancel Order (Bonus): Implement an order cancellation feature, allowing customers to cancel an order if it hasn't 
# been shipped or completed. Ensure that canceled orders are appropriately reflected in the system.
#         Calculate Order Total Price (Bonus): Include an endpoint that calculates the total price of items in a specific 
# order, considering the prices of the products included in the order. This calculation should be specific to each customer
# and each order, providing accurate pricing information.
